# Compilation
Make sure you install the latest version of the windows [SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) and [WDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

The projects are currently set for VS 2022, but you can change them however you see fit.
